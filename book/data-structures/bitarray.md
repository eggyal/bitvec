# Arrays

While `BitSlice` describes a region of borrowed data, `BitArray` provides a
container that can hold and manage such a region.

It is most comparable to the C++ type [`std::bitset<N>`]. It takes the length
of the `BitSlice` as a type-level integer from the `typenum` crate. The full
type declaration is

```rust,ignore
# use bitvec::prelude::*;
pub struct BitArray<
  S: BitStore,
  O: BitOrder,
  N: Elts<S>,
> {
  _ord: PhantomData<O>,
  data: GenericArray<S, N::Output>,
}
```

As described in the [previous chapter], the `BitView` trait is implemented on
the unsigned integers, and on arrays of them. Currently, array support is
limited to arrays up to and including 32 elements long; as Rust type-level
integers mature, this will grow to include all arrays.

This array dereferences to a `BitSlice` region over its entire length. It does
not currently permit shortening its `BitSlice` from either end. If this is a
behavior you want, please file an issue.

## Using a `BitArray`

The `::ZERO` constant is a blank `BitArray` with its memory completely zeroed.
The `::new()` function wraps an existing element or array into a `BitArray`. In
addition, the macro constructor `bitarr!` takes the exact same arguments as the
`bits!` constructor, except that it returns an array directly rather than a
reference to a buffer.

Furthermore, `BitArray` structures and references can be constructed from
`&BitSlice` references using the `TryFrom` trait, just as arrays can be
constructed in the standard library.

Once constructed, `BitArray` offers the `.as_bitslice()` and
`.as_mut_bitslice()` explicit methods, as well as all the standard traits, to
borrow its data as a `BitSlice`. The array has almost no functionality of its
own, and serves only to own a region used as a `BitSlice`.

Once you are done using `BitSlice` to manipulate the array, you can remove the
array with `.into_inner()` and regain the `GenericArray` memory within.

Thatâ€™s everything that the array does! Like regular arrays, it is useful
primarily for its ability to move memory through a program, and has essentially
no behavior in its own right. It is useful for programs that do not have access
to a dynamic allocator, and do not wish to use `static` buffers. However, if you
do have access to an allocator, you will probably prefer to use `BitVec`
instead.
